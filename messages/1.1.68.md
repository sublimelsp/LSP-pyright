## Deprecations

- The `dev_environment` setting is now moved into `settings` with the key of `pyright.dev_environment`.
  This change allows you to override `pyright.dev_environment` in project settings.

  Before:

  ```js
  {
    "dev_environment": "sublime_text",
  }
  ```
  
  After:

  ```js
  {
    "settings": {
      "pyright.dev_environment": "sublime_text",
    },
  }
  ```
